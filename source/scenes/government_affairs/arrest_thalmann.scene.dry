Is it really that simple? Won't his supporters react violently to this suggestion? Some people might consider this to be an anti-democratic abuse of power, using the law in order to target a political opponent.

- @arrest: Arrest him!
- @no_arrest: No, we must not.

@arrest
go-to: deport_violence if rfb_strength >= 200; deport_success if sa_strength < 200

@deport_violence

When the police approach, he is surrounded by the RFB, preventing him from being extricated! We can attempt to force a confrontation, but that may have negative consequences. The Reichsbanner may also attempt to draw off the SA.

- @force_approach: Force the approach!
- @no_arrest: Cancel the deportation.

Unfortunately, our forces fail to disloge the SA from their positions surrounding Hitler. He is seen as both a strong and powerful leader and a victim, further reinforcing his image. The Nazis are left stronger than ever.

@force_success
on-arrival: hitler_deported = 1; sa_strength = sa_strength/2; workers_nsdap -= 10; new_middle_nsdap -= 10; old_middle_nsdap -= 10; rural_nsdap -= 10; unemployed_nsdap -= 10; sa_banned = 1; coup_progress -= 2; nsdap_leader = "Goebbels"
achievement: deport_hitler

The confrontation ends with the police and Reichsbanner prevailing, capturing Hitler so he can be deported! This is a sign of weakness, and his physical distance makes organizing difficult, impeding the Nazi effort to win more votes.

In Thalmann's absence, the Concillator Faction has become the leader of the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, with substantial influence from Joseph Stalin.

achievement: deport_hitler

Somehow, the plan worked! There was minimal resistance to Thalmann's arrest. This is a sign of weakness, and his physical distance makes organizing difficult, impeding the Communist effort to win more votes.

@no_arrest
go-to: root

We will not be arresting Thalmann today.
